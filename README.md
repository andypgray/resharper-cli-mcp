resharper-cli-mcp is an MCP server that runs JetBrains' ReSharper command-line tools and exposes them to C# coding agents over stdio. It is unofficial — not affiliated with or endorsed by JetBrains.

It gives an agent two things a text search cannot: a real ReSharper inspection of your solution (`resharper_inspect`), and ReSharper's own code cleanup applied in place (`resharper_cleanup`). The server shells out to a `jb` you install yourself, and bundles no JetBrains software.

## Quickstart

The server needs the .NET 10 SDK and JetBrains' [ReSharper Command Line Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/ReSharper_Command_Line_Tools.html). Both install as .NET global tools, and neither needs an IDE.

```bash
dotnet tool install -g JetBrains.ReSharper.GlobalTools
dotnet tool install -g Zphil.ReSharperCli
```

Register the server with your MCP client under the command `resharper-cli-mcp`. For Claude Code, add it to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resharper": {
      "command": "resharper-cli-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server finds a single `.sln`/`.slnx` in its working directory. When that directory holds zero or several, set `JB_SOLUTION_PATH` in the config's `env` block or pass `solutionPath` on the call.

VS Code and Cursor users can add the server in one click, once both tools are installed:

## Tools

| Tool | Mutates files | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `resharper_inspect` | no | Runs ReSharper InspectCode and returns the issues, grouped by file. |
| `resharper_cleanup` | yes | Runs ReSharper CleanupCode to reformat and normalize the given files in place. |

Scope `resharper_inspect` with the `files` glob and raise `severity` (`SUGGESTION`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`; default `WARNING`) to control how much comes back. Each issue carries a file, line, severity, rule ID, and message:

```text
Found 2 issue(s) across 1 file(s):

### /repo/src/HomeController.cs
- **Line 8** [WARNING] `RedundantUsingDirective`: Using directive is not required by the code and can be safely removed.
- **Line 24** [SUGGESTION] `FieldCanBeMadeReadOnly.Local`: Field can be made readonly.
```

Call `resharper_cleanup` once, at the end of a task, with every file you changed batched into the one call.

The first run on a solution is slow while ReSharper builds its caches under `--caches-home`; later runs reuse them and finish in seconds. The server caps each run at 5 minutes. If your MCP client's own tool-call timeout is shorter than a cold run needs, the client gives up first. In Claude Code, raise it with a per-server `"timeout"` in milliseconds in `.mcp.json`, or the `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` environment variable; raising it past 5 minutes has no effect, since the server's own cap binds first.

## Configuration

Set these in the MCP client config's `env` block. All are optional.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `JB_SOLUTION_PATH` | Solution to use when the working directory has zero or several. |
| `JB_SETTINGS_PATH` | Explicit `.DotSettings` file to pass to `jb`. |
| `JB_CACHE_HOME` | ReSharper cache directory (default `~/.jb-cache`). |
| `JB_EXTENSIONS` | Semicolon-separated ReSharper plugin IDs to load. |
| `JB_EXTENSION_SOURCE` | Custom NuGet source for those plugins. |
| `RESHARPER_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | Level for the rolling file log (default `Warning`). |
| `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Client output budget; caps large inspection results. |

The `solutionPath` tool argument overrides `JB_SOLUTION_PATH` for a single call. When a result would exceed `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (2.5 characters per token, or 25,000 characters when unset), the server truncates at a line boundary and appends a note saying how much it dropped.

**Solution discovery** tries, in order: the `solutionPath` argument, then `JB_SOLUTION_PATH`, then a single `.sln`/`.slnx` in the working directory (top level only, no parent walk). Zero or several without an override is an error that names the variable to set.

**Settings discovery** tries, in order: `JB_SETTINGS_PATH` (a missing file logs a warning and falls through), then a `.DotSettings` file beside the solution, then `GlobalSettingsStorage.DotSettings` in the JetBrains shared directory, then none.

Logs roll daily under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Zphil.ReSharperCli\logs` on Windows, and the platform-equivalent path elsewhere. Nothing leaves the machine.

## Deriving a style guide for a legacy codebase

Adding this server to a large existing solution unlocks a second workflow: deriving an *intentional* ReSharper style guide from the code you already have, so an inspection flags real house-style deviations rather than un-configured defaults. The server advertises an MCP prompt, `derive_style_guide` (surfaced as a slash command or prompt-picker entry in clients that render prompts), that walks an agent through it.

Be clear on the division of labour: ReSharper's command-line tools have no "infer settings from code" verb, and **this server does not infer settings**. The agent derives the rules from evidence — the code plus whatever is already in the repo (StyleCop, analyzers, an existing `.editorconfig`) — and `resharper_inspect` *validates* them: scope an inspection to a representative folder, then keep or silence each noisy rule until the remaining output is all intentional. The recipe is `.editorconfig`-first (portable across ReSharper, StyleCop.Analyzers, Roslyn, `dotnet format`, and Rider), spilling only ReSharper-only knobs and cleanup-profile definitions into `.sln.DotSettings`. When the codebase genuinely mixes conventions, the prompt pauses and asks rather than guessing.

If a teammate has ReSharper or Rider, prefer JetBrains' first-party [Detect Code Style Settings](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2018/12/05/detection-code-styles-naming-resharper/) for the baseline; it is IDE-only, so this recipe is the path for headless, CI, or no-licence use, and it adds StyleCop reconciliation and severity tuning on top. See also ReSharper's [Use EditorConfig](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Using_EditorConfig.html) and the [InspectCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/InspectCode.html) / [CleanupCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/CleanupCode.html) references. The embedded prompt is the full recipe; this section is only a digest of it.

## Cleanup is cosmetic

`resharper_cleanup` never changes behavior. Its default `Built-in: Full Cleanup` profile fixes formatting and style only, so an agent should write correct logic and let the cleanup pass handle the polish. There is no need to re-inspect or rebuild after it. The default profile handles all of these:

- unused usings, sorted and shortened qualified references
- indentation, spacing, line breaks, and wrapping
- `var` versus explicit type, per the solution's settings
- modifier order, and explicit or implicit modifiers as configured
- redundant parentheses, `this.` qualifiers, casts, and default values
- braces around single statements, per style
- auto-properties, readonly fields, object-creation style, trailing commas, namespace style

Keep the agent's editing effort on logic, types, naming, and architecture. For a legacy codebase where Full Cleanup would churn regions you did not touch, define a narrower profile (for example `Custom: No Reordering`) in the solution's `.sln.DotSettings` and pass its name as `profile`.

## Cleanup reminder hook

The single end-of-task cleanup above is easy for an agent to forget. A Claude Code [PostToolUse hook](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) can nudge it toward the habit without running anything itself. Add this to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "grep -qiE '\"file_path\"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*\"[^\"]*\\.(cs|razor)\"' && printf '%s' '{\"hookSpecificOutput\":{\"hookEventName\":\"PostToolUse\",\"additionalContext\":\"When this task is done, batch every edited .cs/.razor file into one resharper_cleanup call.\"}}' || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

After each `.cs`/`.razor` edit the hook adds a one-line reminder to the agent's context; on any other file it prints nothing and does nothing. It never edits code or calls the tool, so the agent decides when to clean up. The command uses `grep` and `printf`, so it needs a POSIX shell (on Windows, Git Bash).
